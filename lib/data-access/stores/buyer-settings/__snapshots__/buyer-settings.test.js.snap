G FarmaLabs is committed to applying science and global resources to design and develop market leading brands in the cannabis flower, extracts, and edible product areas.</p> <p><strong><ins>History:</ins></strong></p> <p>Family owned and operated, G Farmalabs was conceived in 2007 by husband and wife team Ata and Nicole Gonzalez. Forced to relocate to California in 2009 after the financial crisis known as “The Great Recession,” Ata and Nicole believed the end of marijuana prohibition was near. Upon arriving in California, Ata attended Oaksterdam University and rented their first farm in Northern California. Together they carefully planted and harvested their first batch of marijuana flowers. Nicole is a member of a fourth generation tobacco family and has a strong background in the cigar industry. In 2013, G FarmaLabs launched America’s first complete brand of cannabis products.</p> <p>In 2015, Ata and Nicole’s idea had now become reality. G FarmaBrands was born. G FarmaLabs is the world’s first cannabis company that dedicates their effort to following the traditional lessons adapted from the Tobacco Industry. G FarmaLabs infused the two commercial enterprises to create a variety of products in an emerging market, setting the trend for the future of cannabis by merging the two industries.</p> <p><strong><ins>Process:</ins></strong></p> <p>G FarmaLabs works closely with a team of professionals who designed the California based processing center and production facility called the “Innovation Center” located in Desert Hot Springs, California. They have adopted the phrase “Napa Valley of Cannabis” and focus on blending the finest Domestic Cultivated Cannabis. Consistently cultivated, G FarmaLabs uses the same secret strains, each carefully chosen to guarantee a consistent experience.</p> <p>Perfecting the recipe and process, the G FarmaLabs farmers cultivate, harvest, dry, and trim their seven strains making it possible for customers to experience the aroma and feel the passion and precision the team at G FarmaLabs dedicates to their line of products.</p> <p><strong><ins>Products:</ins></strong></p> <p>Offering a variety of products from pre-rolls to edibles, G FarmaLabs caters to a wide market of cannabis users.
